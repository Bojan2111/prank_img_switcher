Steps to Build Your Chrome Extension
1. Create the File Structure
You'll need the following files:

manifest.json: The extension's configuration.
content.js: The script that runs on the target website to modify the DOM.
Your replacement image (e.g., prank-image.png).
2. Write the manifest.json
This file tells Chrome what your extension does and what permissions it needs. Here's an example:

json
Copy code
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Image Prank Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Replace a specific image on a website with a custom one.",
  "permissions": ["scripting"],
  "host_permissions": ["*://specific-website.com/*"],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["*://specific-website.com/*"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ]
}
Replace specific-website.com with the actual domain.

3. Write the content.js
This script finds the image and replaces its src attribute.

javascript
Copy code
// Wait for the DOM to load
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  // Replace this selector with the one for the target image
  const targetImage = document.querySelector("img");

  if (targetImage) {
    targetImage.src = chrome.runtime.getURL("prank-image.png");
  }
});
4. Add Your Replacement Image
Put your custom image (e.g., prank-image.png) in the extension folder.

5. Load the Extension in Chrome
Go to chrome://extensions/.
Enable "Developer mode" (top-right corner).
Click "Load unpacked."
Select the folder where you've saved the extension files.
6. Test It
Visit the target website, and the logo should now be replaced with your custom image.

Notes & Tips
Selector Specificity: If the website has multiple <img> tags, refine the selector in content.js to target the specific logo. For instance, if the logo has a class name site-logo, use:

javascript
Copy code
const targetImage = document.querySelector("img.site-logo");
Local Changes Only: This only modifies how the website appears on your local machine. No changes are made to the website itself.

Undo the Prank: To undo the prank, simply disable or remove the extension.
